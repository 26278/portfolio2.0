# Jochem de Wit - Portfolio 2.0

My first portfolio got a bit outdated, so I decided to build a new one with my latest projects. Especially because I want to apply for a second internship. 

I decided to build my portfolio in Laravel, because I really like the .blade templates and I haven't worked with PHP lately.
